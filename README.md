# Genetic-Algorithm-Practice
Two genetic algorithm projects I made as practice. The first one titled Project 1 was done by following a guide by Burak Kanber written in Javascript which I translated to Python. The second, Project 2, I designed myself. Project 1 takes a population of strings and mimics natural selection to transform them into input by the user. The second is similar but takes in a coordinate point from the user and mimics natural selection to recreate that coordinate.
